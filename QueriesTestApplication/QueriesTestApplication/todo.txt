items is added with named tag but select query says index not defined insertQueries.VerifyMetaData2()

why this.Name = '\"{teaName}\"' inverted commas

test on all topologies and binary cache

set name = aqib will throw unexpected chacracter encountered exception.(\"aqib\" is correct )

no summary for query service API 
     
       
test with binary cache
test without query indexing
dedicated call
 
Update statement is only supported on JSON serialized cache. exception in insert query

date time issue 
insert queries have comma issue while specifying values . also remove-meta and set-meta

verify tag is given in service  <add key="NCache.ParserBufferSize" value="1024"/>
